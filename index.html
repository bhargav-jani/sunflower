  <div class="emotional-section">
    <h2>Why I'll Always Choose You</h2>
    <p>
      Six years ago at 11:25 PM, I asked "Vidhi Parmar, would you like to be my girlfriend?" I had no idea that call would rewrite my entire life.
    </p>
    <p>
      From three naive conditions to becoming rock solid together. From kilometers apart to traveling the world together. From that first DM to planning forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      You waited when I wasn’t ready. You stayed through misunderstandings, overthinking spirals, and every version of me that was still figuring things out. You didn’t just love me — you grew with me. You made me calmer. Stronger. Less impulsive. More certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      You made me discover my definition of love — it’s your smile. There is nothing more satisfying, more grounding, more beautiful than knowing you’re happy. I never thought anything could take priority over everything else. But you did.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      This isn't just version 6.0. This is a lifetime build. I love you.
